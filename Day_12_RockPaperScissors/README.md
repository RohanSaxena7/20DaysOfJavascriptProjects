<b>Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Project</b></br>
- The application features a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.</br>
- The user can select one of three options- either Rock, Paper or Scissor, and the computer then generates a random response which in turn decides if the player has won, lost or the game came to a draw.</br>
- All the necessary files of the project are present in this folder.</br>
